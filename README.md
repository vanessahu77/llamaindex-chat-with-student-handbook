# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š Regional Economic Outlook Copilot

Regional Economic Outlook Copilot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer questions about Regional Economic Outlook using information on reported produced by IMF and data from World Bank. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4o and LlamaIndex to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the data it has been trained on.

## Overview of the App

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`.
- Use `Copilot` class to interact with the chatbot by passing in a question and a list of messages and get a response.
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a Retriever to retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query.
- `Economic Data Visualization` that pulls in historical and latest data on major world econmic indicators, and provides time series and geographical visualizations.
